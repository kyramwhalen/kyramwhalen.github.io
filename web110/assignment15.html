       For my final project, I aim to delve into the realm of social media and its impact on modern society. Building upon the objectives outlined in our course, I will explore essential concepts of social networking and Web 2.0. Furthermore, I plan to conduct a comprehensive analysis of various social media tools and applications, examining their functionalities, benefits, and ethical considerations. Through this project, I seek to deepen my understanding of the dynamic landscape of social media, while also gaining practical experience in setting up and utilizing popular platforms. By elucidating the nuances of different social media tools and applications, I aspire to contribute to a nuanced discourse on the ethical implications of their usage in today's digital age.

        Through completing these activities, I have gained a deeper understanding of project management 
        and the importance of effective planning. Additionally, I have learned practical skills such as 
        creating Gantt charts and integrating multimedia elements into web pages. I believe these 
        skills will be valuable in both my academic and professional endeavors.
