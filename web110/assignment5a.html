    <p>My first activity for this assignment was to explore social media essentially. Nowadays there hardly isn’t a moment where I’m not connected. Being informed is part of my daily routine at this point. To start off I looked through the platform information. What surprised me the most was the number of names that I had heard way back when from my parents. Whatsapp, Linkedin, plenty of names that I didn’t know were still in service. It’s rather remarkable that even to this day these applications are still useful. In the future it would probably be wise to keep an eye on the most up to date sites. At the same time, what sites provide better things than others. Efficiency is always the name of the game. 
    
    The second activity, I looked through the list and I decided to explore the 2 social’s that I am most unfamiliar with: Instagram and Facebook. I hardly use Instagram and from what I’ve learned about it I’m kind of not surprised. Not only has it been surpassed by apps like Tiktok. It also has made its share of mistakes by adding a shop way back when. Although tiktok has done the same, we shall see later on if history will repeat itself. Facebook on the other hand is a site that my parents know better than I do. There's not much difference to modern day social media, besides one thing. Something I hadn’t considered before: Comfort for the user. Usually I’d think that the newest thing is the most efficient, however, Facebook in my opinion is designed for those in their middle ages I’d say. Modern day social media is fast paced, short attention spans, and bright/loud topics. Facebook is a bit more luxurious, people scroll at their own pace. Which I’d definitely say is more appealing to older generations than all the noise that comes from modern day social media. </p>
