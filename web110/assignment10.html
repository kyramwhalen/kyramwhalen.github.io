    <p>This was a tad more tricky than I was expecting. Learning how to put images/videos as well as audio within these sites has been rather eye opening. The biggest thing I've picked up is how important making sure the file is correct per browser. I stayed up all night just trying to get it to work on my own mac. The other realization I had halfway through, is that this would be very important when it comes to digital advertising. As a graphic artist and prop maker, video tutorials and reference pictures of my work would kind of just be a given thing to add. This will definitely come in handy.</p>
