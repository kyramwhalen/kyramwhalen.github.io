    <p>The first activity I chose to do was to verify Internet Activity. This actually helped me out big time. I didn’t previously know how to check my IP address, as I had never had to before. Thankfully everything is in order and I had no issues. However there is one thing that I had consistently had beef with since I got a gaming console. PING. It would seem even on this computer, my location in my house affects my connection. Hence why every now and then, my internet drops so that my father and brother can do as they please. Very frustrating, but it should definitely prove useful when setting up new internet connections or troubleshooting.

    
    The second activity I chose to do was to review my IP address settings. As I said before, I never previously had to do so. To be honest I didn’t even know an IP address needed settings to begin with. The Internet seems to be a bit more complicated than I had previously thought. Strange to me that something meant for ease of access to the world, also to an extent has a difficult OS. As a college student with his parents, I can already see this becoming a necessity when it comes down to setting up or fixing my own connection when I move out. Definitely dodging some bullets with this one.</p>
