    <p>In this activity I decided to learn about Piracy and Intellectual Property. This is something that I only know so much about. However, since reading, I realize that it’s way more strict than I had previously thought. Apparently, just having stripped copyrighted music saved somewhere is in fact an infringement. Which I thought was a bit overkill at first. However, perspective is everything. Would I want my work stripped from things without credit or being paid for it? Not one bit. However, I also know what it's like to be a fan of music from something like Star Wars. They are infamous for not including all of their music. So naturally, I go a tad feral when I find the one song I’ve been looking for after years of searching. Really good to know about this though… Important when creating music, videos, or any medium for that matter.
