    <p>  In these activities we learned about HTMl. Looking at terms, tags, and the HTML structure as a whole. Whilst looking into these, I also learned how to utilize them. The simple tags in the activities allowed me to make an updated index page. Which now has an easy link to all my current and future assignments. I could see this coming in handy when formating another website of some kind. If I ever find the need to make a website, this definitely will come in handy. Even just knowing the simple things. It will give me a leg up in the future should I decide to go that route.
